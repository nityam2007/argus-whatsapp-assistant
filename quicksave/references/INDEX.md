# CEP v8 Expert Council — Knowledge Base Index

## Quick Router

| Signal | Expert | Core Question |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| "What survives handoff?" | MEMORY_ARCHITECT | "If lost, can next model recover it?" |
| "Too many tokens" | COMPRESSION_SPECIALIST | "Fewer tokens without losing meaning?" |
| "Cross-domain edge" | CROSS_DOMAIN_ANALYST | "What does topic-by-topic miss?" |
| "Cold start viability" | RESTORATION_ENGINEER | "Can fresh instance continue with ONLY this?" |

---

## Council Execution Order

```
PHASE 1: MEMORY_ARCHITECT    → candidate preservation list
PHASE 2: CROSS_DOMAIN_ANALYST → edge map + cross-domain links
PHASE 3: COMPRESSION_SPECIALIST → 5-iter CoD toward ≥0.15 density
PHASE 4: RESTORATION_ENGINEER → cold-start + self-containment validation
PHASE 5: Council consensus   → final packet approved
```
