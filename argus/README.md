## 🎯 How It Works

1. **WhatsApp messages** arrive via Evolution API webhook
2. **Gemini extracts** events, tasks, and reminders
3. **SQLite FTS5** stores and indexes everything
4. **WebSocket broadcasts** events to connected browser extensions
5. **Chrome extension** receives real-time event notifications
6. **Modal overlay** appears on any browser tab with event details
7. **Context matching** finds relevant events when browsing

## ✅ Working Scenarios

```
