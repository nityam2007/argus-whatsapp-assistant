## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Multi-Interval Alerts** - Events now create 3 time triggers (24h, 1h, 15min before) instead of just 1
  - `ingestion.ts`: Creates `time_24h`, `time_1h`, `time_15m` triggers per event

  - `scheduler.ts`: `checkTimeTriggers()` now checks all 7 time-based trigger types
  - `types.ts`: `TriggerTypeEnum` expanded with new trigger types
- **View My Day (Reschedule UX)** - Conflict popup now shows "📅 View My Day" button

  - `server.ts`: New `GET /api/events/day/:timestamp` endpoint
  - `background.js`: New `GET_DAY_EVENTS` message handler
  - `content.js`: `showDayScheduleInline()` renders inline day timeline in conflict modal with color-coded dots (green=ok, red=overlap, blue=new)
- **Gemini System Prompt** - All Gemini calls now include a system message via `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant
  - Defines Argus identity, Hinglish understanding, spam/promo detection rules

- **Service Keywords Expanded** - Added canva, figma, notion, slack, zoom to `serviceKeywords` in ingestion.ts

### Changed
- **Dashboard: "Active Triggers" → "Scheduled"** - Hid internal trigger count from users; now shows `scheduledEvents` count instead
- **Conflict Popup Buttons** - Changed from "🔄 Suggest Another Time" to "📅 View My Day" (primary), "✅ Keep Both" (secondary)

### Technical
- `getUnfiredTriggersByType()` signature changed from union literal to `string` for flexibility
- `TriggerType` import added to `db.ts` and `ingestion.ts` for typed interval arrays

## [2.4.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Canva Events Not Triggering** - `getContextEventsForUrl()` now matches by `location` field when `context_url` is null (OR clause in SQL)
- **Scheduled Events Not Found** - `searchEventsByLocation()` and `searchEventsByKeywords()` now check `status IN ('pending', 'scheduled')` instead of just `'pending'`
- **Canva URL Not Detected** - Added `canva.com` pattern to `URL_PATTERNS` in matcher.ts

### Changed
- **Humanized Conflict Popup** - Changed from "Schedule Conflict!" to "Hmm, you might be double-booked" with conversational tone
- **Conflict Detail Section** - Changed from red to orange styling, added formatted date/time display

### Tested
- All 4 scenarios pass via `test-scenarios.sh`:
  - Goa Cashew: 4 context triggers
  - Netflix Cancel: 1 trigger
  - Canva Pro: 2 triggers ("Get Canva Pro" + "Canva Pro Edu")
  - Calendar Conflict: AI correctly identifies overlapping Team standup + Client call

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **XSS Vulnerabilities** - Added `escapeHtml()` to index.html dashboard; all event titles, descriptions, locations, WhatsApp messages, and phone numbers are now sanitized
- **Duplicate `scheduleEvent()`** - Removed duplicate function definition in index.html (was defined twice)
- **Wrong Initial Filter** - Dashboard `currentFilter` changed from `'pending'` to `'discovered'` to match the active tab
- **Misleading `dismissEvent` Alias** - Removed `dismissEvent = snoozeEvent` alias (dismiss ≠ snooze)
- **Missing CSS Badge Classes** - Added `badge-dismissed` and `badge-pending` styles
- **Version Header Mismatch** - background.js header comment updated from v2.2 to v2.4

### Added
- **AI Chat Test Tool** - Dashboard Test Tools section now includes AI Chat tester (`/api/chat` endpoint)

- **Complete API Docs** - Settings section now lists all 14 endpoints including set-reminder, snooze, ignore, dismiss, acknowledge, chat

### Changed
- **Hardcoded Name Removed** - sidepanel.html quick action changed from "What did Rahul recommend?" to generic "Show all recommendations from friends"

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **AI Chat Sidebar** - Side panel for conversational AI assistant with full event context
  - `sidepanel.html` / `sidepanel.js` - Dark-themed chat UI with markdown rendering
  - `/api/chat` endpoint - Context-aware Gemini conversations
  - `chatWithContext()` in gemini.ts - Fetches recent events for grounded answers

- **SidePanel Chrome API** - `chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior()` + `OPEN_SIDE_PANEL` message handler in background.js
- **Action Detection Pipeline** - `detectAction()` for NLP-based actions (mark done, cancel, reschedule) before event extraction

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Service Worker Crash** - Removed `"type": "module"` from manifest.json background config; background.js uses classic scripts, not ES modules (caused line 49 crash)
- **EventStatusEnum Mismatch** - Added `'snoozed'` and `'ignored'` to Zod schema in types.ts (were used by db.ts but missing from validation)
- **Shadowed Variable** - Renamed duplicate `searchText` to `travelSearchText` in ingestion.ts `processMessage()` to avoid variable shadowing
- **Snooze Missing Body** - sidepanel.js snooze action now sends proper JSON body (`{ minutes: 30 }`) with `Content-Type: application/json` header
- **SidePanel Not Opening** - Added `chrome.sidePanel.open()` handler and `setPanelBehavior` initialization in background.js

### Changed
- **background.js v2.4** - Version bump, sidePanel integration
- **CRITICAL DATE/TIME RULE** - Gemini prompt now explicitly forbids fabricated dates; must use only dates from message text or current timestamp

## [2.3.2] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Duplicate popups** - Server now sends ONLY ONE notification per event (not both notification + conflict_warning)
- **Scheduler popup types** - Now sends correct message type based on popupType (trigger for reminders, notification for snooze)

### Tested

  - `meeting` - "Team standup tomorrow at 10am"
  - `deadline` - "Project deadline Friday 5pm"
  - `reminder` - "Don't forget to call grandma"
  - `travel` - "Trip to Manali next month"
  - `task` - "Buy groceries, pick up laundry"
  - `subscription` - "Cancel Spotify subscription"

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Chrome Popup buttons** - Changed from inline onclick to addEventListener with data-action attributes
- **Dismiss loop bug** - Added dismissedEventIds and handledEventIds Sets to prevent popup reopening
- **Content script actions** - Added schedule, snooze, ignore, complete actions to handleAction()
- **Background.js message handlers** - Added SNOOZE_EVENT and IGNORE_EVENT handlers
- **WebSocket auto-refresh** - Webapp now handles all event types: event_scheduled, event_snoozed, event_ignored, event_completed

### Changed
- **popup.js v2.2** - Buttons disable during API calls, auto-refresh every 5s
- **content.js v2.2** - Tracks handled events to prevent re-showing
- **background.js v2.3** - Better logging for all API calls

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Proper Event Status System** - Complete lifecycle management with meaningful statuses:
  - `discovered` → New event from WhatsApp (needs user action)
  - `scheduled` → User approved, will show context reminders & 1hr before notifications
  - `snoozed` → User said "later", will remind again in 30 minutes
  - `ignored` → User doesn't care (hidden but not deleted)
  - `reminded` → 1-hour before reminder was shown
  - `completed` → User marked as done
  - `expired` → Event time passed without action

- **New Event Actions**:
  - `📅 Schedule` - Approve event for reminders (discovered → scheduled)
  - `💤 Snooze` - Remind again in 30 minutes (any → snoozed)
  - `🚫 Ignore` - Hide event without deleting (discovered → ignored)
  - `✅ Done` - Mark as completed (scheduled → completed)
  - `↩️ Restore` - Bring back ignored event (ignored → scheduled)
  - `🗑️ Delete` - Permanent removal (only for ignored/completed)

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/events/:id/set-reminder` - Schedule event
  - `POST /api/events/:id/snooze` - Snooze for X minutes
  - `POST /api/events/:id/ignore` - Ignore event
  - `POST /api/events/:id/complete` - Mark done
  - `DELETE /api/events/:id` - Delete permanently

- **Snooze Scheduler** - Background job checks every 30s for snoozed events that are due
- **Extension host_permissions** - Changed from localhost-only to `<all_urls>` for popup on any tab
- **Tab detection** - Popups now show on any active tab, not just localhost:3000

### Changed
- **Dashboard tabs** - New: 🆕 New | 📅 Active | 💤 Snoozed | ✅ Done | 🚫 Ignored | 📋 All
- **Chrome popup tabs** - New: 🆕 New | 📅 Active | ✅ Done
- **Stats** - pendingEvents now = discoveredEvents + snoozedEvents
- **Action buttons** - Contextual based on event status (no delete for discovered)

### Fixed
- **Popup not appearing on external sites** - manifest.json host_permissions now `<all_urls>`
- **Context reminders require approval** - Only shows for `scheduled` events
- **Event flow clarity** - Removed ambiguous "pending" status

### User Flow
1. WhatsApp message → Event discovered → Popup on current tab
2. User clicks "📅 Schedule" → Status = scheduled
3. User visits netflix.com → Context reminder popup (only if scheduled)
4. User clicks "✅ Done" → Status = completed

OR

1. User clicks "💤 Snooze" → Status = snoozed, reminder_time = now + 30min
2. After 30 min → Scheduler re-shows popup, status → discovered

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Calendar conflict detection** - Warns when new events conflict with existing events (±1 hour window)
- **Travel/Goa scenario** - Any message mentioning travel destinations sets context_url for URL matching
- **Service name extraction** - Subscriptions use just the service name (netflix, hotstar) not full domain
- **Enhanced Gemini prompt** - Better extraction of service names and travel destinations

### Fixed
- **URL matching** - Now case-insensitive, matches if URL contains the keyword anywhere
- **Subscription context** - "want to cancel netflix" now correctly sets context_url="netflix"
- **Travel context** - "Rahul recommended cashews in Goa" now sets context_url="goa"

### Scenarios Working
- ✅ **Netflix Subscription** - "cancel my netflix" + visit netflix.com → shows reminder
- ✅ **Goa Cashew** - "cashews in goa" + visit goatourism.com → shows reminder  
- ✅ **Calendar Conflict** - Create overlapping event → shows conflict warning

### Technical
- `checkEventConflicts()` function in db.ts for conflict detection
- `context_url` now stores just keywords (netflix, goa) not full domains
- URL matching: `LOWER(url) LIKE '%' || LOWER(context_url) || '%'`

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Root dev script** - `npm run dev` from project root runs both Evolution API and Argus concurrently
- **Subscription keyword detection** - Classifier now recognizes netflix, amazon, prime, subscription keywords
- **Typo tolerance** - Message classifier handles typos like "cancle" → "cancel"
- **Intent pattern recognition** - Detects "want to", "need to", "planning to" patterns

### Fixed
- **Chrome notification removed** - All popups now display as in-page overlays (no more native Chrome notifications)
- **Context check API response** - Returns full `contextTriggers` array instead of just count
- **Popup persistence** - Context reminder popups stay visible until user takes action
- **Tab change handling** - Popups no longer disappear when switching tabs

### Changed
- **Extension v2.1** - Complete rewrite of background.js and content.js for cleaner code
- **Consistent logging** - All extension logs use `[Argus]` prefix
- **Variable naming** - Standardized variable names across extension files

### Scenarios Supported
- ✅ Netflix Subscription (visit netflix.com → shows cancel reminder)
- ⏳ Goa Cashew (visit travel sites → shows recommendation)
- ⏳ Gift Intent (visit shopping sites → shows suggestion)
- ⏳ Insurance Accuracy (visit insurance sites → shows correction)
- ⏳ Calendar Conflict (scheduling conflicts → shows warning)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

  - `context_reminder` - URL-based triggers (Netflix scenario) - persistent until done
  - `conflict_warning` - Calendar conflict alerts
  - `insight_card` - Recommendations and suggestions

### Architecture Decisions
- No FAISS/Vector embeddings - using SQLite FTS5 instead
- No OpenAI - Gemini only (per hackathon requirements)
- Single container per user model
- 90-day hot window for context matching
- URL detection only (no DOM reading for MVP)
